            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I have a wide range of interests that keep me engaged, curious, and constantly learning. My passion for technology fuels much of my creativity and drive; I’m particularly drawn to programming and the endless possibilities it offers to build, solve problems, and innovate. I love experimenting with new languages and frameworks, always seeking to expand my skill set and stay ahead in the tech world. Outside of tech, I’m a big fan of storytelling in all its forms—especially through anime, mystery and sci-fi novels, and comics, where I can dive into diverse worlds filled with complex characters and imaginative plots. My taste in movies and series is equally varied, from classic films to the latest releases, each providing fresh perspectives and creative inspiration.</p>

            <p>Recently, I’ve taken up photography, with a focus on capturing real-life scenarios and those fleeting moments that reveal life’s unique details. Photography has quickly become a creative outlet that lets me observe and appreciate the beauty in everyday scenes—whether it’s an expressive face, a meaningful interaction, or a perfectly framed landscape. Altogether, my passion for tech, love of storytelling, and new interest in photography keep me balanced, inspired, and always exploring new ways to understand and engage with the world.</p>
